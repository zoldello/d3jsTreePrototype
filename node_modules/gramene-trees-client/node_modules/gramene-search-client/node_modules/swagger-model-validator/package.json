  "readme": "# Validate incoming objects against Swagger Models for Node.js\r\n[ ![Codeship Status for atlantishealthcare/swagger-model-validator](https://codeship.io/projects/a4ec3310-3b9b-0132-060c-1e7e00028aa9/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/42728)\r\n\r\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/swagger-model-validator.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/swagger-model-validator/)\r\n\r\nThis is a validation module for [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) models Node.js.\r\n\r\nSee the [swagger-node-express](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express/blob/master/SAMPLE.md) sample for more details about Swagger in Node.js.\r\n\r\n## What's Swagger?\r\nThe goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swager removes the guesswork in calling the service.\r\n\r\nCheck out [Swagger-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more. \r\n\r\n## Validating Swagger Models?\r\nA Swagger Model contains the definitions of the incoming (or outgoing) object properties.  Validating an incoming object matches the Swagger Model Definition is a valuable check that the correct data has been provided.\r\n\r\nThis package provides a module to do just that.\r\n\r\n## Swagger versions\r\nThis project should work against both Swagger 1.2 and Swagger 2.0.  Please create a pull request if you have any fixes for Swagger 2.0 support but please remember to retain support for Swagger 1.2 as well.\r\n\r\n### Validation Notes\r\nIt will validate int32 properly but the way javascript handles int64 makes it impossible to accurately validate int64s.\r\nAs long as the value can be parsed by parseInt in javascript it will be accepted as an int64.\r\n\r\nIt currently treats float and decimal the same but this is because javascript cannot cope with a decimal (at the moment).\r\nAs long as the value can be parsed by parseFloat in javascript it will be accepted as a float or a decimal.\r\n\r\nIt validates the date and date-time correctly.  It treats all dates (and date-times) as dates and tests with a parseDate\r\ncheck.  If this passes then it checks 'date' format against a length of 10 (a quick check against the ISO8601 standard, a full-date must be 10 characters long).\r\n\r\nAs from version 0.3 it will now validate models referenced by the $ref keyword but it will only do this if it is called\r\nby the swagger function validateModel or if the native validate is called with a model array passed in.\r\n\r\nAs from version 1.0.0 it will now validate arrays in models.  It will validate arrays of a type and arrays of a $ref.\r\n### Installation\r\nInstall swagger-model-validator\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install swagger-model-validator\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a validator and pass your swagger client into it.\r\n```\r\nvar Validator = require('swagger-model-validator');\r\nvar validator = new Validator(swagger);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can call validateModel on swagger to validate an incoming json object.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar validation = swagger.validateModel(\"modelName\", jsonObject, _allowBlankTarget_, _disallowExtraProperties_);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns a validation results object\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  valid: true,\r\n  errorCount: 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor if validation fails\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  valid: false,\r\n  errorCount: 2,\r\n  errors: [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Error',\r\n      message: 'An error occurred'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Error',\r\n      message: 'Another error occurred'\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also call the validation directly\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar validation = validator.validate(object, swaggerModel, swaggerModels, allowBlankTarget, disallowExtraProperties);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill return the same validation results but requires the actual swagger model and not its name.  _The swaggerModels\r\nparameter is required if you want models referenced by the $ref keyword to be validated as well._\r\n\r\n### Allowing blank targets to validate\r\nFrom 1.0.2 any empty objects passed in as targets will fail validation.  You can bypass this by adding a `true` value to\r\nthe method at the end.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar validation = swagger.validateModel(\"modelName\", target, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow an empty object `{ }` to be validated without errors. We consider a blank object to be worthless in most\r\ncases and so should normally fail, but there is always the chance that it might not be worthless so we've added the bypass.\r\n\r\n### Preventing extra properties\r\nFrom 1.2 an optional parameter can be passed into the validation request to control if extra properties should be disallowed.\r\nIf this flag is true then the target object cannot contain any properties that are not defined on the model.\r\nIf it is blank or false then the target object __can__ include extra properties (this is the default behaviour and the same\r\nas pre 1.2)\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar validation = swagger.validateModel(\"modelName\", target, true, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Custom Field Validators\r\nYou can add a custom field validator for a model to the validator from version 1.0.3 onwards.  This allows you to add a\r\nfunction that will be called for any specific field that you need validated with extra rules.\r\n\r\nThis function should be in the form\r\n```\r\nfunction(name, value) {\r\n  if(error) {\r\n    return new Error(error);\r\n  } else {\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt can return either a single Error object or an array of error objects.  These errors will be passed back through the\r\nvalidator to the end user.\r\n\r\n### Adding a field validator\r\nSimply make a call to the validator method ```addFieldValidator``` providing the ```modelName```, ```fieldName``` and\r\nthe validation function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalidator.addFieldValidator(\"testModel\", \"id\", function(name, value) {\r\n    var errors = []\r\n    if(value === 34) {\r\n        errors.push(new Error(\"Value Cannot be 34\"));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if(value < 40) {\r\n        errors.push(new Error(\"Value must be at least 40\"));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return errors.length > 0 ? errors : null;\r\n});\r\n```\r\nNow the validator will call this extra function for the 'id' field in the 'testModel' model.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple custom validators to the same field.  They will all be run.  If a validator throws an exception it\r\nwill be ignored and validation will continue.\r\n\r\n## Handling Returned Errors\r\nBe careful with the results as javascript Errors cannot be turned into JSON without losing the message property.\r\n\r\nWe have added two methods to help with this.\r\n\r\nGetErrorMessages() which returns an array of strings (one for each error) which contain the text of the error.message property.\r\nGetFormattedErrors() which returns an array of objects (one for each error) which contains all of the custom properties for each error and the text of the error.message property.\r\n\r\nJust passing the Validation Response errors array out will result in the loss of the error.message property.  Most errors would appear as empty objects.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Atlantis Healthcare Limited.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
